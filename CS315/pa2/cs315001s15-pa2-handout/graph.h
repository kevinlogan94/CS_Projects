/* ----graph.h-------
	graph class for cs315 project 3
	given by instructor JWJ


	The graph class stores a matrix in incidence format.
	It is assumed that the size of the graph is < 1001.
	You can store  undirected graphs.
	For undirected graphs we just give the upper half of the matrix.
	Format for undirected graphs:

	3    		<---- size
	u   	 	<---- type
	0 20 30   	<---- first upper row
	   0 10   	<---- second upper row
	      0   	<---- third upper row

	which represents a 3 x 3  weighted undirected graph with
	the following matrix: 

	vertex  1       2       3        
	1       0       20      30        
	2       20       0      10        
	3       30      10       0        


	The methods edge, and edge_weight, allow you to see
	if there is a connection between the values.
